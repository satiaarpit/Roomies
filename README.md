# Roomies



## Inspiration :

I just moved to USA, and wanted an app to use for managing expenses among room amtes. Wanted something simple but yet powerfull app, and thus decided to develop 'Roomies', an app which helps you to manage your household expense among room mates


## What it does :

This is a mobile app that helps you to keep a track of expenses among room mates, generates a share sheet, so that you can settle amounts at the end!
##Features : 
1) Add new bill. For adding new bill you need to fil in  
	a) Bill date.  
	b) Bill amount.  
	c) Shop name or description.  
	d) Paid by : Select the peron who paid it.  
	e) Shared by : Whom the amount will be shared among.  
2) Edit bills.  
3) View bills.   
4) View each persons contributon.  
5) See each persons expense.  
6) Settle amounts : This feature will provide a way for distributing amount. Once you settle amounts, it will automatically delete all the bills from your list.
